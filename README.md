## Narrative Ideas

#### Login Screen
- Have the first screen be a login screen where the user must type in a password, they cannot play the rest of the game without first passing the login screen.
- Once they type in the password correctly the screen switches to a new project in unity. They can only type on the keyboard, they cant actually interact with it. 
- There is a go to sleep button that the player can use at any time. going to sleep just restarts the game.
- There is another postit note that says IDEAS on it, but the postit note is blank. Is this too on the nose?
